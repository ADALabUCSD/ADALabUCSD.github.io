== Project Genisys
~~~ 

=== Overview

Genisys is a new kind of data system that enables ADA applications to easily deploy ML 
models in environments ranging from the cloud to personal devices. 
Genisys exploits deep learning-based ML models to see, hear, and understand unstructured 
data and query sources such as speech, images, video, time series, and text. 
We call this vision of type-agnostic data analytics /database perception/. 
Watch this space for more details.
